All the React Hook Used so far :

1) useState : 
        used to update the state of a variable at present at multiple or singular location in UI
        Ex.   const [length , setLength] = useState(0)
        useState returns an array of varible and a function that is changing the value of that variable 
        '(0)' - is the initial value of the length variable
